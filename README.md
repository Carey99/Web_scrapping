cd Web_scrapping
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Tutorial
Basic Concepts
Web scraping involves two main tasks:

Fetching the web page: Retrieve the HTML content of a page using an HTTP request.
Parsing the content: Extract and process the data using an HTML parser.
Using Requests
The requests library is commonly used to fetch web pages:


import requests  

url = "https://example.com"  
response = requests.get(url)  
if response.status_code == 200:  
    print("Page fetched successfully!")  
    print(response.text)  # HTML content  
Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
The BeautifulSoup library helps parse HTML and extract information.


from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  

html_content = response.text  
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')  

# Example: Extracting all links  
links = soup.find_all('a')  
for link in links:  
    print(link.get('href'))  
Example: Scraping Headlines
Here‚Äôs a simple example to scrape headlines from a news website:


url = "https://news.ycombinator.com/"  
response = requests.get(url)  
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')  

# Extract headlines  
headlines = soup.find_all('a', class_='storylink')  
for idx, headline in enumerate(headlines, start=1):  
    print(f"{idx}. {headline.text}")  
Best Practices
Respect Robots.txt: Check a website's robots.txt file to ensure you‚Äôre allowed to scrape it.
Avoid Overloading Servers: Use delays between requests.
Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling for broken links, server issues, etc.
Legal Considerations: Scraping is subject to copyright and terms of service. Always ensure you comply with applicable laws.
